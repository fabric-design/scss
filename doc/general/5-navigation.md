# Navigation
Navigation structure and used elements highly depend on system **Information Architecture** structure. Think about it before you make decision about your navigation and menu structure.

## Context Links
The most natural way to move through the system is a system of well placed context links that leads to proper place.

## Tabs
Tabs can be used to divide page content into sections. It should be used to show only content relevant to specific user actions.

## Overlays
Layers are very efficient in showing detailed data or advanced actions without leaving current context. They should be considered as a standard way to show details in Fabric based products.
